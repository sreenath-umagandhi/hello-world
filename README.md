# hello-world
This is a new beginning.

Hi! My name is Sreenath Umagandhi. I work as a Senior Software Developer for a Microbiology company. I pretty much work as a full-stack developer developing web applications in React, service applications using Node.js, SSRS for running reports, and use SSMS for managing our data.
